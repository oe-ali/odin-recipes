    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza is a dish that uses kneaded dough that is then shaped into a flat bread. Afterwards a tomato sauce<br /> 
        is spread over the bread, then come the various toppings which vary between mushrooms, onion slices, pepperoni<br />
        slices, grated cheese, mozzarella, etc, and in the end the pizza is being baked in the oven.

    <p>
        The origins of this dish trace back to Italy which got popularized thanks to American cooks.

        <li>1 teaspoon of black pepper</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon of oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Bring out the yeast</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Dissolve the yeast and sugar in half a cup of warm water.</li>
            <li>Let it stand for about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Add more things</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Now add the 4 3/4 cups of flour, oil, salt and the 1 1/2 cups of water into the yeast mixture.</li>
            <li>Beat at medium speed for about five minutes.</li>
            <li>Add a little at a time of the flour that's leftover during the five minutes to keep the dough from being too sticky.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Toss and turn</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Coat a bowl with 1 tbsp of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in the bowl and turn over to coat all sides.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Take cover!</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Cover the bowl and then place in an oven that just has the oven light turned on for 45 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Punch and form!</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove dough from the oven.</li>
            <li>Punch and turn the dough in the bowl.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process a few times.</li>
            <li>Then cut the dough in equal bits until they are roughly the size of a baseball.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough bits into balls.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough balls again and place them for 30 minutes into the fridge.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Prepare the sauce</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Take all the ingredients for the sauce and mix them in a mixer.</li>
            <li>You now have pizza sauce.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Form the pizza</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sprinkle some flour on the table so the dough doesn't stick to it.</li>
            <li>To form the pizza place your fingers on both hands together.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough and repeat again and again until you have the crust all around the dough.</li>
            <li>Next, turn over the dough and using your fingers, smooth over where your indentions from the other side formed, <br>going around to complete the full circle.</li>
            <li>Take the dough into one and and then toss it into the other hand, while you are pulling at the edge of the dough <br>to stretch it with the first hand.</li>
            <li>Now, you are going to take the dough that's in your second hand and toss it to the first hand while pulling at the <br>edge of the dough with the second hand.</li>
            <li>Continue to do this, slightly turning your dough each time and pulling on the bottom part to stretch it out.</li>
            <li>If you tear the dough, don't worry, just pinch the hole closed when you have it laid out on the pan.</li>
            <li>The more practice you do, the easier it will be and you won't tear the dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternatively, after forming the crust you could just use both hands to stretch the dough out while it's <br>laying on the surface, just stretch the dough, spin a little, stretch, spin, stretch, etc, until you have stretched it all over.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Bake and top it!</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bake in an oven that's been preheated to about 250°C for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take the dough from the oven and start applying sauce the sauce until you reach the crusts of the pizza.</li>
            <li>Cover with whatever cheese and toppings you want, evenly covering the pizza.</li>
            <li>Place the pizza back into the oven and turn the heat up to 250°C again.</li>
            <li>After 8 minutes or when the crust turns golden take the pizza out of the oven.</li>
            <li>While it's the other pizza's turn you can now slice the finished pizza into slices.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ul>
