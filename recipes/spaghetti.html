    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaghetti is one of the simplest Italian dishes there is. It is a long, cylindrical pasta that softens when<br /> 
        it's in contact with hot water. When the spaghetti is done it can be eaten as is.

    <p>
        There is a way to give this dish a taste if it isn't enjoyable. Simply creating a tomato sauce with vegetables<br />
        and ground beef for instance is enough to raise the taste of the dish.
