    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Pide</strong> is a type of flat bread that carries its origins in Turkey. Essentially, this is <br />
      a staple of the Turkish breakfast cuisine. This bread is topped with sesame seeds.  
    </p>
    <p>
       There's also a version of pide that looks like a boat which is semi-open so one can see which filling <br />
       has been used (either white-cheese-filling, ground beef or mashed potatoes). We will focus on the plain<br />
       Turkish Flat Bread, though.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Warm milk (wholemilk or 2%)</li>
        <li>Instant dry yeast</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>

        <li>Yogurt</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Make the dough</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large bowl whisk milk, water, olive oil, sugar, salt, instant dry yeast and egg white.</li>
            <li>Add the flour one cup at a time and mix well until combined and the dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl and let it sit for 30 minutes.</li>            
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Shape the dough</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sprinkle the surface generously with flour.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to the surface.</li>
            <li>Shape it into a boule and make sure it's floured on all sides.</li>
            <li>Cut the dough into 8 pieces.</li>
            <li>Place two of the dough balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Cover gently and let them rise for 20 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Prepare the glaze and final shaping</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF and place an empty baking dish in the lower rack.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl mix egg yolk, yogurt and water.</li>
            <li>Brush a bit of the glaze on the dough balls and with your fingers, spread them into round circles with about 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Using your fingers, first make indentations on the dough about 1 inch from the edge to make a circle.</li>
            <li>Then with your fingers make diagonal indentations in two different directions to make diamonds inside that circle.</li>
            <li>Repeat the same process with the remaining 6 dough balls.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Bake the bread</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the oven is hot make the indentations again on the dough.</li>
            <li>Top with sesame seeds and place the baking sheet on the middle rack.</li>
            <li>Fill the baking dish on the lower rack with 2 cups of water and close the oven door.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for 15-18 minutes until golden on top.</li>
            <li>Once out of the oven, cover the loaves with a damp paper towel.</li>
            <li>The steam of the bread with be trapped and your bread will be soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Repeat the baking process with the remaining loaves.</li> 
        </ul>
    </ol>
