# odin-recipes
This is a short project that showcases the various skills that I picked up 
during previous Odin Project lessons.
What I'll be making is a recipe site containing the HTML boilerplate, various
lists (ordered or unordered), paragraphs, headings, etc...
The only thing that'll be missing is the CSS code that is supposed to give my
project a style that is easy on the eyes.
